# Buy me a coffee (or beer)

As I'm usually sitting in a cafe doing the Polo Ninja enhancements, it'd be
great to be treated to a coffee for all the great stuff coming your way. If it's
later in the day or nearing the weekend, I wouldn't reject a beer either. :-)

Consider donating 0.002 BTC or more to this address:

Oh yes, and at the time of writing, 0.002 BTC was just enough to get a nice
big cup of coffee or beer. If it's more now, means you're probably happy, given
you had some bitcoin in the past. :-)

Thanks & cheers!
